Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------
Feature: VIEW INVENTORY

We are making a Warehouse Inventory Tracker. A core component of an inventory tracker is the ability to be able to see the inventory stored inside of the warehouse. So this was one of the first features we thought of implementing in our project. This feature can be split into multiple smaller steps. The user can view individual items in the inventory, view the whole inventory, and view the inventory by category/tag.

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

Branching
----------

Branching strategy is listed [here](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a02/group-14/warehouse-inventory-system/-/blob/main/README.md).

Provide screen shot of a feature being added using your branching strategy
successfully. The [GitLab Graph tool can do this](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-summer2019/cook-eBook/-/network/develop),
as well as using `git log --graph`.

SOLID
-----

The issue created for the violation of a SOLID principal is [here](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a02/group-15/simple-forum/-/issues/16).


Agile Planning
--------------

Once we learned about how the UI layer operates in android studio, we changed the logic layer to add in a method to return an array of every item object in the system. This makes displaying the objects dynamically on the screen easier, but as we did not really know about how the UI systems are setup in android studio we had to change on the fly. We also ended up pushing the app colour pallete and the app dropdown features to iteration 2, as they were small low priority features that were not necessary to the functionality of the current iteration.
