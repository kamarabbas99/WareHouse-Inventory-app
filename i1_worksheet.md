Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project.
Provide links to the
feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit
that was used complete the feature.

Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

Branching
----------

Branching strategy is listed [here](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a02/group-14/warehouse-inventory-system/-/blob/main/README.md).

Provide screen shot of a feature being added using your branching strategy
successfully. The [GitLab Graph tool can do this](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-summer2019/cook-eBook/-/network/develop),
as well as using `git log --graph`.

SOLID
-----

The issue created for the violation of a SOLID principal is [here](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a02/group-15/simple-forum/-/issues/16).


Agile Planning
--------------

Once we learned about how the UI layer operates in android studio, we changed the logic layer to add in a method to return an array of every item object in the system. This makes displaying the objects dynamically on the screen easier, but as we did not really know about how the UI systems are setup in android studio we had to change on the fly. We also ended up pushing the app colour pallete and the app dropdown features to iteration 2, as they were small low priority features that were not necessary to the functionality of the current iteration.
