There was an additional package called “objects” which was used for the domain-specific objects (DSOs).<br></b>

            <br>* We discussed and developed the interface for each layer before doing any actual development. This helped us in the long term by not having to perform too many redesigns when it would have been challenging too.<br>* We had a healthy mix of skills which made creating the teams straightforward.<br>* Our team was positive during the entire development which made the whole development process engaging.<br>* We used test driven development for the database and logic classes which helped give us confidence in our work.<br>* We had routine meetings with most team members being able to make it. Most of them were productive and useful during the integration phase of the project.<br></b>

            <br>One particular design smell that we have in the database layer is that we have a decent amount of repeated code. This was a result of the way we structured the design, where each table was given their own class.<br>One “brilliant” design decision was to use dependency injection with our database layer. We had a generic IDBLayer interface that held the required methods for each database layer class. It made testing simple.<br>Another design decision we thought was good was using a singleton to store the references to the database. The singleton class made it simple to retrieve instances that required to only exist once.<br></b>

Going into the development, we did not have any experience with AndroidStudio and were uncertain about how good it would look and how functional it would be.<br>Similarly, the persistent data feature worked better than expected. Our team’s experience with databases was with SQLite and we had never used HSQLDB or made a database simply in a .script file.

Some user stories that had high priority changed to medium or low as other features were seen as more important. For example the ability to add/remove multiple items was originally a high priority, but we needed to spend more time on other features so it was lowered. The scope of the project also had to decrease slightly due to time constraints where some features, like ordering or order automation, had to be cut from the final iteration.</b>

In other words, technical debt is important to consider in new code.<br>Working together introduces a lot of complexity, but we were able to produce a better and much larger project than if we were to do it on our own.<br>Tracking time spent working is not just for management, it helps us understand our own capabilities and be able to give better estimates for time critical tasks.<br></b>
