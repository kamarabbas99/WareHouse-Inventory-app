## Branching Strategy
We are following a strategy similiar to the Git branching strategy. The two main branches to be aware of are:

1. The `main` branch. 
	- Where fully working releases for each iteration will be. 
2. The `development` branch.
	- Where current development is being done. 

In addition to these two main branches, each new feature will have their own branch that is created from the `development` branch. The specific names of these branches are determined by the team working on it. Once that branch has its work completed, it will then be merged into the 'development' branch and deleted.
